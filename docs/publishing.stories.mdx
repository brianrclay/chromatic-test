## Publishing

After your package and documentation updates have been approved and merged into `master`, you can run through publishing your changes.

Kyper uses the [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) tool to help manage each component as an individual package. For a comprehensive list of the commands available, please read the [docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). Make sure you authenticated with NPM via the console and you have access to the @kyper group.

---

Run all the unit tests in the root directory.

```
npm run test
```

Double check that your dependencies are in line or as expected with the rest of the packages.

```
npm run syncpack -- list-mismatches
```

Verify your changes to the package(s) that have changed since the last published release.

```
lerna diff
```

Update the package version(s) following [semvar](https://semver.org/). _View the docs for more options and flexibility_

```
lerna version major | minor | patch
```

Publish your changes to NPM.

```
lerna publish
```
