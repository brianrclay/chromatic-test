## Creating Documentation

Kyper React uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) along with the Docs addon for local development and documentation. Documentation and Stories use the [MDX](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/mdx.md) format.

### Core Components

Let's begin with the core concepts of the documentation.

##### MetaTag

```
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks

<Meta
  component={Button}
  decorators={[withDesignTokens]}
  title="Button"
/>
```

The `MetaTag` requires a `component` and a `title`. The `title` should be unique across all of the documentation pages. The `component` should be the component you wish to document.

The `decorators` prop allows us to wrap/execute code for the entire documentation page. In this instance, we are providing the design tokens and context to all the components.

##### PeerDependencies

```
import { PeerDependencies } from 'addons/packages/index.js'
import packageJson from '../package.json'

<PeerDependencies json={packageJson} />
```

With the emphasis on dependencies not being installed, it's necessary to have a visual reminder of what is required to be installed for the components to function. Importing the package.json file and passing it to the `PeerDependencies` component will render those requirements for you.

##### Story

```
import { Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks

<Story name="Button">
  <FlexContainer>
    <Button variant="primary">
      Primary
    </Button>
  </FlexContainer>
</Story>
```

Each `Story` component should represent a single visual state of a component. However, it's common to also group multiple implementations of, say, a button into a single story. Every `Story` component defined will generate a new linkable section displayed in the navigation.

##### Preview
```
import { Preview } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'

<Preview>
  <Story>
    ...
  </Story>
</Preview>
```

If you'd like to display the JSX that was used to render your story, wrap it in the `Preview` component.

##### Props
```
import { Props } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'

<Props of={Button} />
```

If you desire to display the props for a component, pass it to the `Props` component. This will display everything it can parse out of the defined `propTypes`. For more prop documentation options, you can explore [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen)
