## Unit Tests

Unit tests are done with a comibination of the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) libraries. The default linting rules of the [eslint-plugin-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jest) have also been applied.

To run all the unit tests, run the following command from the root directory:

```
npm run test
```

To run the unit tests for a specific component, use the following format from the root directory:

```
npm run test -- ./packages/button/
```

To run a process that watches for changes to associated files, run the following command from the root directory:

```
npm run watch
```
